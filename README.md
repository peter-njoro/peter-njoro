# Peter Was Here

> “Why be normal when you can build things that occasionally look like AI magic and occasionally look like a cry for help?”

Hey, I'm Peter — a developer who talks to computers more than humans, mostly because the computers argue less. If you ever see commits at 2AM, just assume everything is under control.

## About Me

- Python developer with a long-term situationship with Django  
- FastAPI enjoyer (because sometimes speed and simplicity are nice)  
- JavaScript and React practitioner with functional decision-making most days  
- C++ user strictly for mental toughness  
- Currently building **ReconRoll** — an improved facial recognition attendance system  
- On the path to becoming a machine learning engineer  
- Currently deep in data analytics, modeling, and turning messy datasets into “oh, that actually makes sense”

## Tools I Use

| Tech Stack | What I Use It For |
|------------|-------------------|
| Python, Django, FastAPI | Backend systems, APIs, automation, AI integrations |
| React + JavaScript | Frontend interfaces that actually look decent |
| OpenCV, face_recognition, NumPy, Pandas | Computer vision, AI experiments, data analysis |
| Docker, Git, GitHub Projects | Shipping real software and staying organized |
| Arch Linux | Because I enjoy living dangerously and customizing everything |
