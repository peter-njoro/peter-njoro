# Peter Was Here

> “Why be normal when you can build things that make people question your sleep schedule?”

Hey, I'm Peter — a developer who talks to computers more than humans, mostly because the computers argue less. If you ever see commits at 2AM, please mind your business.

## About Me

- Python developer with an unhealthy attachment to Django  
- JavaScript survivor (some days it cooperates)  
- C++ enthusiast strictly for character development  
- Currently building: [FaceTrack Lite](https://github.com/peter-njoro/facetrack-Lite) — facial recognition attendance, because I’d rather automate remembering people  
- Learning AI and ML the classic way: bug, debug, repeat

## Tools I Use (to build things, not suffer… mostly)

| Tech Stack | What I Use It For |
|------------|-------------------|
| Python + Django | Web apps, APIs, backend logic that occasionally behaves |
| JavaScript + Bootstrap | Frontend work that somehow ends up looking decent |
| OpenCV, face_recognition, NumPy | Computer vision and AI experiments |
| Docker, Git, GitHub Projects | Keeping my projects alive and versioned |
| Ubuntu (WSL) | Linux inside Windows, because life’s complicated enough |
